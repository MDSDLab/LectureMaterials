# Hints

 * Blockly [documentation](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/overview) can help you a lot
 * For TextBlock, the &lt;p&gt; tag should be generated by default, but if the Type attribute is specified, another tag is required instead (e.g. &lt;h1&gt;), since &lt;p&gt; tag should not contain block elements.
 * The generator stub generated by BlockFactory does not compile directly with all Blockly versions, if an error occurs, you should change the Blockly.javascript namespace to Blockly.JavaScript
 * The built-in validation, which is evaluated when individual elements are joined, works only if a value is set on both sides. For related elements, you may want to use the setOuput function to set the type (e.g. validator)
 * The this.setOnChange function can be used in many ways for blocks, with which you can specify your own validation logic
 * There are two levels of validation: warning and actual error, which can be called by using setWarningText and setEnable
 * As mentioned in the Blockly documentation, the fields and inputs defined in each block can be queried (getField/getInput). Note that where two blocks are connected (e.g. a function gets a parameter), it is often best to use the connection property instead
 * The Blockly API helps you remove existing items or add new ones (e.g. removeField/appendField)
 * For validators, built-in HTML5 validation is sufficient. For custom error messages, we recommend using the setCustomValidity JS function ([example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5272433/how-to-set-custom-validation-messages-for-html-forms)), so you don't need to generate a separate Javascript file. However, it is worth paying attention to the fact that validation only runs on Submit. There is no need to check wheter there is a Submit button placed on the Form.
