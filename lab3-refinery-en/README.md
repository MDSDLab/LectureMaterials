# Laboratory 3 - Refinery, model query and model generation

## Steps to solve the lab

1. Get familiar with the partial modeling language available in Refinery : [Refinery language reference](https://refinery.tools/learn/language/)
2. The development environment for the lab is available in the online web editor of Refinery: https://refinery.services/
3. From the [mdsd-2025-lab3-refinery](https://github.com/MDSDLab/mdsd-2025-lab3-refinery) repository, copy the **webtest-refinery** folder to the root of your own repository.
4. Solve the tasks listed below.
5. Commit your solution and add the **hw3** git tag to your last commit!

> Don't forget to occasionally save your problem files to a local machine (`Save` or `Save as...` key, `CTRL+S`).

## Goal of the lab

The goal of this lab is to get familiarized with graph-based modeling and model generation. In this lab, you will create predicates using [Refinery](https://refinery.tools/) for models based on the WebTest language. The predicates are intended to perform various checks on the models of the WebTest language.
Then, you will generate test models for the WebTest language based on the previously defined predicates, using the model generation feature of Refinery.

## Development environment

For the development of the graph predicates and the model generation, you can use the online editor of the [Refinery](https://refinery.tools/) graph generator framework, available at [▷Refinery](https://refinery.services/) or [run a server for yourself](https://refinery.tools/learn/docker/).


## List of the tasks

Solve the following tasks:
1. [Create graph predicates](predicates.md)
2. [Generate test models](model-generation.md)
