# Try the example

The **webtest.example** application contains some examples, which show the final goal: how the application should behave after the first and second labs.

Inside the project the **webtest** folder contains the program codes written in the WebTest language, while the **src/test/java** folder contains those Java codes which should result automatically from the WebTest files.

Click on the **webtest.example** project with the right mouse button, and select **Run As > JUnit Test**! Observe, how Selenium controls the browser through the JUnit tests! Check the logs and the contents of the **output** folder, too!
